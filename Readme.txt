Thanks for downloading this template!

So.... I chose this template with the intention of it being able to scale up with built in features and sections as the organization grows and we look to potentially get more out of the site than just contact submissions. There is still a good deal of code that needs to be reviewed and commented out for the time being so that the site loads easily in the stripped down version we are using. 

The contact form will need a bit of tweaking to get the inputs how we want them to be and we just need to plug in the destination email address. I hope to be able to loop back and finish this build sooner than later but if someone is able to pick it up and run with it, I am not going to complain at all. I hope this is all useful.

Peace and Solidarity,
